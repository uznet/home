In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards the use of conversational IVR systems with natural language interaction. This type of IVR system allows users to interact with the system in a more natural and conversational way, which can improve the overall user experience and increase customer satisfaction. When it comes to building a conversational IVR system, VoiceXML is a popular technology that offers a number of advantages over other technologies like Voice API or legacy IVR. In this blog post, we’ll explore the key benefits of building a conversational IVR with natural language interaction in VoiceXML.

## #1. More Complex Natural Language Interactions

One of the biggest advantages of building a conversational IVR with natural language interaction in VoiceXML is that it allows for more complex connection options for conversational dialog engines. This is because VoiceXML provides the ability to create dynamic web coding. By using natural language understanding (NLU) and machine learning techniques, the system can control user intent and respond with appropriate telephony prompts and actions.

## #2. Greater Flexibility and Customization

Another advantage of using VoiceXML for conversational IVR systems is that it offers greater flexibility and customization compared to other technologies like Voice API or legacy IVR systems. With VoiceXML, developers can create highly customized and personalized calling experiences that are tailored to the specific needs and preferences of each interaction. This can help to increase engagement and improve the overall effectiveness of the IVR system.

## #3. Improved Integration with other Systems

A conversational IVR system with natural language interaction build in VoiceXML provides a better integration with other systems, including CRMs, databases, web services, AI engines and other third-party platforms. This allows businesses to create more sophisticated and integrated applications workflows in real-time, which can lead to increased efficiency, accuracy and productivity.

## #4. Faster Development and Deployment

VoiceXML also allows for faster development and deployment of conversational IVR systems compared to other technologies. This is because it is an XML tags based language that can be connected to a wide range of Speech APIs and Languages, which makes it easier to find the right development tools and resources to build, test, and deploy.

## #5. Improved Analytics and Insights

Finally, using a conversational IVR system with natural language interaction in VoiceXML can also provide improved analytics and insights into user behavior and system performance. This can help businesses to identify areas where the system can be improved, optimize workflows, monitor speech recognition and record user experiences, and provide valuable data for strategic AI decision-making.

In conclusion, building a conversational IVR system with natural language interaction in standard VoiceXML scripting provides numerous advantages over other technologies like Voice API or legacy IVR systems. From more natural and conversational interactions to greater flexibility and customization, faster development and deployment, improved integration with others systems, and better analytics and insights, VoiceXML can help businesses create highly effective and efficient IVR systems that meet the needs of their customers and stakeholders.
